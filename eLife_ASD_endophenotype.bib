              557 controls previously collected across 16 international
              institutions. The combination of ABIDE I and ABIDE II provides
              investigators with 2156 unique cross-sectional datasets allowing
              selection of samples for discovery and/or replication. This
              sample size can also facilitate the identification of
              neurobiological subgroups, as well as preliminary examinations of
              sex differences in ASD. Additionally, ABIDE II includes a range
              of psychiatric variables to inform our understanding of the
              neural correlates of co-occurring psychopathology; 284 diffusion
              imaging datasets are also included. It is anticipated that these

               for qualitative and quantitative studies of gross neuroanatomy,
               functional neuroanatomy and for neurosurgical planning. The
               digital nature of the data allows for the reconstruction of
               realistic three-dimensional models of an individual brain which
               can be sliced at arbitrary orientations for optimal visual
               inspection of often complex neuroanatomy and pathology. This is
               particularly relevant in the assessment of potential
               neuroanatomical correlates of temporal lobe epilepsy.
               Re-formatting of contiguous thinly sliced (1--2 mm thick)
               volumetric MRI data along planes parallel and perpendicular to
               the temporal plane allow finer visual discrimination and greater
               standardisation in qualitative procedures than previously
               possible. Perhaps more exciting are the applications of
               quantitative analysis where, for instance, accurate measurements
               of hippocampus and/or amygdala volumes provide important
               indicators of unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis which compare
               favourably with EEG and more invasive methods of lateralising
               the epileptogenic focus (Jack et al., 1990; Cascino et al.,
               1991; Watson et al, 1992; Cendes et al., 1993 a,b). For
               instance, by combining volumetric measurements of both
               hippocampus and amygdala, Cendes et al., (Chapter 9) quote
               correct lateralisation of focus in 93 of 100 temporal lobe
               epilepsy cases. The study of epilepsy arising from cortical
               abnormalities has been limited in the past by the difficulties
               of visualising the cortical surface from a set of conventional
               two-dimensional MRI slices. New acquisition techniques with
               gradient echo as opposed to spin echo techniques allow for an
               improved signal-to-noise ratio in thin slices in times
               compatible with clinical examinations. Whole brain coverage with
               thin slice data is now possible, such that partial volume
               effects are minimised with consequent improvements in fine
               detail. Numerous authors have reported dramatic improvements in
               the assessment of cortical dysplasia and grey matter
               heterotopias, particularly for more subtle abnormalities
               (Palmini et al., 1991a,b,c; Barkovich and Kjos, 1992a,b,c). The
               impact of this improved raw data when combined with new
               techniques for generating three-dimensional surface renderings
               in reasonably interactive circumstances is yet to be fully
               realised but initial experience is promising. At present, most
               studies have relied upon visual inspection to identify
               abnormalities in gyration on three-dimensional surface-rendered
               MRI. Such methods are quite acceptable for gross pathologies
               but, in a manner similar to mesial temporal volumetrics, the
               identification of more subtle distortions may require
               quantitative analysis of left/right differences and comparison
               of individual gyral surface area or gyral/sulcal locations with
               previously established population norms. Cook et al., (Chapter
               47) have approached the problem by application of fractal
               analysis to two-dimensional MRI images from normal and frontal
               lobe epilepsy (FLE) patients. The grey-white matter interface
               was extracted by image processing procedures as a continuous
               contour and the fractal dimension, an index of contour
               complexity, derived. Results indicate that 10 of 16 FLE patients
               had a fractal index more than 3 standard deviations (3SD) below
               normal. In its present form, the method provides a non-specific
               indicator of cortical abnormality, yielding an overall index of
               complexity rather than identifying specific abnormalities, and
               is implemented in two dimensions rather than three dimensions.
               Nevertheless, it illustrates the potential of quantitative
               analysis for detecting aberrant cortical morphology. For a more
               directed analysis of cortical folding, a model of normal
               neuroanatomical variability, expressed in three-dimensional
               coordinates, is necessary. Keyserlingk and co-workers have
               developed methods for digitising sulcal patterns from
               post-mortem brains and constructed a map, with cuboid elements
               of 4 mm or 8 mm edge length, of major sulcal anatomy from 30
               such brains (Keyserlingk et al., 1983, 1985, 1988; Niemann et
               al, 1988). The advent of high resolution MRI scanning offers
               finer spatial and contrast resolution in normal brain in vivo.
               At the Montreal Neurological Institute, MRI and PET imaging
               techniques are combined with three-dimensional graphics and
               computational analysis in the study of functional neuroanatomy
               of cognitive and sensorimotor processing. As part of this
               ``brain mapping'' programme, we have collected a database of
               over 300 MRI volumes from young normal subjects and are
               presently engaged in a series of projects whose long-term goal
               is the construction of a probabilistic description of normal
               neuroanatomy derived from high-resolution (1 mm thick slices)
               MRI data. In this chapter we briefly describe the current brain
               mapping environment at our institute and the current development
               of the MRI atlas project in both volumetric and surface domains.",

              suggests that early symptoms of autism usually emerge late in the
              first or early in the second year of life after a period of
              relatively typical development. The authors prospectively
              examined white matter fiber tract organization from 6 to 24
              months in high-risk infants who developed autism spectrum
              disorders (ASDs) by 24 months. METHOD: The participants were 92
              high-risk infant siblings from an ongoing imaging study of
              autism. All participants had diffusion tensor imaging at 6 months
              and behavioral assessments at 24 months; a majority contributed
              additional imaging data at 12 and/or 24 months. At 24 months, 28
              infants met criteria for ASDs and 64 infants did not.
              Microstructural properties of white matter fiber tracts reported
              to be associated with ASDs or related behaviors were
              characterized by fractional anisotropy and radial and axial
              diffusivity. RESULTS: The fractional anisotropy trajectories for
              12 of 15 fiber tracts differed significantly between the infants
              who developed ASDs and those who did not. Development for most
              fiber tracts in the infants with ASDs was characterized by higher
              fractional anisotropy values at 6 months followed by slower
              change over time relative to infants without ASDs. Thus, by 24
              months of age, those with ASDs had lower values. CONCLUSIONS:
              These results suggest that aberrant development of white matter
              pathways may precede the manifestation of autistic symptoms in
              the first year of life. Longitudinal data are critical to
              characterizing the dynamic age-related brain and behavior changes

              imaging-based studies on functional connectivity in autism
              spectrum disorder (ASD) have generated inconsistent results.
              Interpretation of findings is further hampered by small samples
              and a focus on a limited number of networks, with networks
              underlying sensory processing being largely underexamined. We
              aimed to comprehensively characterize ASD-related alterations
              within and between 20 well-characterized resting-state networks
              using baseline data from the EU-AIMS (European Autism
              Interventions-A Multicentre Study for Developing New Medications)
              Longitudinal European Autism Project. METHODS: Resting-state
              functional magnetic resonance imaging data was available for 265
              individuals with ASD (7.5-30.3 years; 73.2\% male) and 218
              typically developing individuals (6.9-29.8 years; 64.2\% male),
              all with IQ > 70. We compared functional connectivity within 20
              networks-obtained using independent component analysis-between
              the ASD and typically developing groups, and related functional
              connectivity within these networks to continuous (overall) autism
              trait severity scores derived from the Social Responsiveness
              Scale Second Edition across all participants. Furthermore, we
              investigated case-control differences and autism trait-related
              alterations in between-network connectivity. RESULTS: Higher
              autism traits were associated with increased connectivity within
              salience, medial motor, and orbitofrontal networks. However, we
              did not replicate previously reported case-control differences
              within these networks. The between-network analysis did reveal
              case-control differences showing on average 1) decreased
              connectivity of the visual association network with
              somatosensory, medial, and lateral motor networks, and 2)
              increased connectivity of the cerebellum with these sensory and
              motor networks in ASD compared with typically developing
              subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate ASD-related alterations in
              within- and between-network connectivity. The between-network
              alterations broadly affect connectivity between cerebellum,
              visual, and sensory-motor networks, potentially underlying

              studies have found atypical synchronization of brain activity in
              ASD. However, no consensus has been reached on the nature and
              clinical relevance of these alterations. Here, we addressed these
              questions in four large ASD cohorts. Using rs-fMRI, we identified
              functional connectivity alterations associated with ASD. We
              tested for associations of these imaging phenotypes with clinical
              and demographic factors such as age, sex, medication status, and
              clinical symptom severity. Our results showed reproducible
              patterns of ASD-associated functional hyper- and
              hypoconnectivity. Hypoconnectivity was primarily restricted to
              sensory-motor regions, whereas hyperconnectivity hubs were
              predominately located in prefrontal and parietal cortices. Shifts
              in cortico-cortical between-network connectivity from outside to
              within the identified regions were shown to be a key driver of
              these abnormalities. This reproducible pathophysiological

              future and making social inferences. This Review describes
              progress in understanding the organization and function of

              high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the
              default network is not a single network, as historically
              described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks.
              The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also

              support a general class of processing function dependent on
              internally constructed rather than externally constrained

  abstract  = "Autism is a diagnostic label based on behavior. While the
               diagnostic criteria attempt to maximize clinical consensus, it
               also masks a wide degree of heterogeneity between and within
               individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Understanding this
               multi-level heterogeneity is of high clinical and translational
               importance. Here we present organizing principles to frame
               research examining multi-level heterogeneity in autism.
               Theoretical concepts such as 'spectrum' or 'autisms' reflect
               non-mutually exclusive explanations regarding
               continuous/dimensional or categorical/qualitative variation
               between and within individuals. However, common practices of
               small sample size studies and case-control models are suboptimal
               for tackling heterogeneity. Big data are an important ingredient
               for furthering our understanding of heterogeneity in autism. In
               addition to being 'feature-rich', big data should be both
               'broad' (i.e., large sample size) and 'deep' (i.e., multiple
               levels of data collected on the same individuals). These
               characteristics increase the likelihood that the study results
               are more generalizable and facilitate evaluation of the utility
               of different models of heterogeneity. A model's utility can be
               measured by its ability to explain clinically or mechanistically
               important phenomena, and also by explaining how variability
               manifests across different levels of analysis. The
               directionality for explaining variability across levels can be
               bottom-up or top-down, and should include the importance of
               development for characterizing changes within individuals. While
               progress can be made with 'supervised' models built upon a
               priori or theoretically predicted distinctions or dimensions of
               importance, it will become increasingly important to complement
               such work with unsupervised data-driven discoveries that
               leverage unknown and multivariate distinctions within big data.
               A better understanding of how to model heterogeneity between
               autistic people will facilitate progress towards precision
               medicine for symptoms that cause suffering, and person-centered

              cortical thickness measurements from 156 individuals with autism
              spectrum disorder (ASD) from four different sites. The proposed
              approach consists of two main stages: a domain adaptation stage

              integrating regional predictions into a whole-brain severity

              various approaches, assessments of utility, and applications to
              various psychiatric disorders and related traits. Although
              genetic risk prediction has become increasingly straightforward
              to apply and common in published studies, there are important
              pitfalls to avoid. At present, the clinical utility of genetic
              risk prediction is still low; however, there is significant
              promise for future clinical applications as the ancestral
              diversity and sample sizes of genome-wide association studies
              increase. We discuss emerging data and methods aimed at improving
              the value of genetic risk prediction for disentangling disease
              mechanisms and stratifying subjects for epidemiological and
              clinical studies. For all applications, it is absolutely critical
              that polygenic risk prediction is applied with appropriate
              methodology and control for confounding to avoid repeating some
              mistakes of the candidate gene era.",

              there were 3 indications of underconnectivity in the group with

              functional connectivity or the correlation of the time series of
              the activation) between the frontal and parietal areas of
              activation was lower for the autistic than the control

              through which many of the bilaterally activated cortical areas
              communicate, were smaller in cross-sectional area in the autistic

              These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation

              been implicated in a number of psychiatric disorders, including
              ASD. Here we review converging multimodal evidence for DMN
              dysfunction in the context of specific components of social
              cognitive dysfunction in ASD: 'self-referential processing' - the
              ability to process social information relative to oneself and
              'theory of mind' or 'mentalizing' - the ability to infer the
              mental states such as beliefs, intentions, and emotions of
              others. We show that altered functional and structural
              organization of the DMN, and its atypical developmental

              for plotting child development in terms of height or weight as a
              function of age, normative models chart variation in clinical
              cohorts in terms of mappings between quantitative biological
              measures and clinically relevant variables. An emerging body of
              literature has demonstrated that such techniques are excellent
              tools for parsing the heterogeneity in clinical cohorts by
              providing statistical inferences at the level of the individual
              participant with respect to the normative range. Here, we provide
              a unifying review of the theory and application of normative
              modelling for understanding the biological and clinical

              ASD.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsPopulation-based,
              multinational cohort study including full birth cohorts of
              children from Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Israel, and Western
              Australia born between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2011,
              and followed up to age 16 years. Data were analyzed from
              September 23, 2016 through February 4, 2018.Main Outcomes and
              MeasuresAcross 5 countries, models were fitted to estimate
              variance components describing the total variance in risk for ASD
              occurrence owing to additive genetics, maternal, and shared and
              nonshared environmental effects.ResultsThe analytic sample
              included 2 001 631 individuals, of whom 1 027 546 (51.3\%) were
              male. Among the entire sample, 22 156 were diagnosed with ASD.
              The median (95\% CI) ASD heritability was 80.8\% (73.2\%-85.5\%)
              for country-specific point estimates, ranging from 50.9\%
              (25.1\%-75.6\%) (Finland) to 86.8\% (69.8\%-100.0\%) (Israel).
              For the Nordic countries combined, heritability estimates ranged
              from 81.2\% (73.9\%-85.3\%) to 82.7\% (79.1\%-86.0\%). Maternal
              effect was estimated to range from 0.4\% to 1.6\%. Estimates of
              genetic, maternal, and environmental effects for autistic
              disorder were similar with ASD.Conclusions and RelevanceBased on
              population data from 5 countries, the heritability of ASD was
              estimated to be approximately 80\%, indicating that the variation
              in ASD occurrence in the population is mostly owing to inherited
              genetic influences, with no support for contribution from
              maternal effects. The results suggest possible modest differences

              = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+,
              versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly
              but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely
              highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many
              men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ
              score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did
              not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University
              did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but
              scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher
              than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an
              earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with
              scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored
              highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad
              winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge
              humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 32+ on the
              AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV
              criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics,
              and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and
              interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a

              brain, arguably our most complex system, poses a particular
              challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity
              will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a
              baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the
              brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as
              the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by
              flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting
              state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations in
              the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of changes
              in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during a wide
              variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative metabolic and
              circulatory measurements from positron-emission tomography to
              obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain. Areas of
              activation were conspicuous by their absence. All significant
              deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were increases,
              signifying deactivations, and resided almost exclusively in the
              visual system. Defining the baseline state of an area in this
              manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that consistently
              exhibit decreases from this baseline, during a wide variety of
              goal-directed behaviors monitored with positron-emission
              tomography and functional MRI. These decreases suggest the

              areas representing more abstract functions, but an overarching
              framework for the association between structure and function is

              primary sensory/motor functions and at the other end, transmodal
              regions that, in humans, are known as the default-mode network

              The degree to which genetic variation is unique to individual
              disorders or shared across disorders is unclear. To examine
              shared genetic etiology, we use genome-wide genotype data from
              the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls
              in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder,
              autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and

              univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic
              variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs
              explained 17-29\% of the variance in liability. The genetic
              correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between
              schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 $\pm$ 0.04 s.e.),
              moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder

              holds the promise to reveal functional biomarkers of
              neuropsychiatric disorders. However, extracting such biomarkers
              is challenging for complex multi-faceted neuropathologies, such
              as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets increase
              sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of
              uncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new
              challenges, akin to those face in realistic diagnostic
              applications. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of inter-site
              classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an application to
              the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large
              (N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we
              investigate pipelines that extract the most predictive biomarkers
              from the data. These R-fMRI pipelines build participant-specific
              connectomes from functionally-defined brain areas. Connectomes
              are then compared across participants to learn patterns of
              connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals
              with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for
              participants from the same acquisition sites or different,
              unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for the various steps of
              the pipeline lead to 67\% prediction accuracy on the full ABIDE
              data, which is significantly better than previously reported
              results. We perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of
              the data defined by different inclusion criteria. These enables
              detailed analysis of the factors contributing to successful
              connectome-based prediction. First, prediction accuracy improves
              as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of subjects
              available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of
              paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas
              extracted from large R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases
              in the classification tasks.",

              Gazal, Steven and Patterson, Nick and Price, Alkes L",
  abstract = "Complex traits and common diseases are extremely polygenic, their
              heritability spread across thousands of loci. One possible
              explanation is that thousands of genes and loci have similarly
              important biological effects when mutated. However, we
              hypothesize that for most complex traits, relatively few genes
              and loci are critical, and negative selection---purging
              large-effect mutations in these regions---leaves behind
              common-variant associations in thousands of less critical regions
              instead. We refer to this phenomenon as flattening. To quantify
              its effects, we introduce a mathematical definition of
              polygenicity, the effective number of independently associated
              SNPs (Me), which describes how evenly the heritability of a trait
              is spread across the genome. We developed a method, stratified LD
              fourth moments regression (S-LD4M), to estimate Me, validating
              that it produces robust estimates in simulations. Analyzing 33
              complex traits (average N = 361k), we determined that
              heritability is spread ∼4$\times$ more evenly among common SNPs
              than among low-frequency SNPs. This difference, together with
              evolutionary modeling of new mutations, suggests that complex
              traits would be orders of magnitude less polygenic if not for the
              influence of negative selection. We also determined that
              heritability is spread more evenly within functionally important
              regions in proportion to their heritability enrichment;
              functionally important regions do not harbor common SNPs with
              greatly increased causal effect sizes, due to selective
              constraint. Our results suggest that for most complex traits, the
              genes and loci with the most critical biological effects often
              differ from those with the strongest common-variant associations.",

  abstract  = "In the field of machine learning, semi-supervised learning (SSL)
               occupies the middle ground, between supervised learning (in
               which all training examples are labeled) and unsupervised
               learning (in which no label data are given). Interest in SSL has
               increased in recent years, particularly because of application
               domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images,
               text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of
               SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the
               field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and
               perspectives on ongoing and future research.Semi-Supervised
               Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying
               the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation,
               manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is
               the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to
               algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative
               models, the book describes algorithms that implement the
               low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and
               algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then
               discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL
               practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark
               experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions
               for SSL research. The book closes with a discussion of the
               relationship between semi-supervised learning and
               transduction.Olivier Chapelle and Alexander Zien are Research

               patterns and relationships between FC and behavior in a group of
               participants consisting of individuals with and without ASD. One
               subtype was defined by increased FC within distinct networks of
               brain regions and decreased FC between networks compared with
               the other subtype. A separate FC pattern distinguished ASD from
               controls. The interaction between subtypes and diagnostic groups

              to follow developmentally variable outcomes. Both supervised

              Functional MRI (FMRI) studies have focused on connectivity in the
              context of psychological tasks. However, even in the absence of a
              task, the brain exhibits a high degree of functional
              connectivity, known as intrinsic or resting connectivity.
              Notably, the default network, which includes the posterior
              cingulate cortex, retro-splenial, lateral parietal cortex/angular
              gyrus, medial prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, temporal
              lobe, and parahippocampal gyrus, is strongly active when there is
              no task. Altered intrinsic connectivity within the default
              network may underlie offline processing that may actuate ASD
              impairments. Using FMRI, we sought to evaluate intrinsic
              connectivity within the default network in ASD. Relative to
              controls, the ASD group showed weaker connectivity between the
              posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus and

              concern because of their early onset, lifelong persistence, and
              high levels of associated impairment. Little is known about the
              associated psychiatric disorders that may contribute to
              impairment. We identify the rates and type of psychiatric
              comorbidity associated with ASDs and explore the associations
              with variables identified as risk factors for child psychiatric
              disorders. METHOD: A subgroup of 112 ten- to 14-year old children
              from a population-derived cohort was assessed for other child
              psychiatric disorders (3 months' prevalence) through parent
              interview using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment.
              DSM-IV diagnoses for childhood anxiety disorders, depressive

              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic disorders,
              trichotillomania, enuresis, and encopresis were identified.
              RESULTS: Seventy percent of participants had at least one
              comorbid disorder and 41\% had two or more. The most common
              diagnoses were social anxiety disorder (29.2\%, 95\% confidence
              interval [CI)] 13.2-45.1), attention-deficit/hyperactivity
              disorder (28.2\%, 95\% CI 13.3-43.0), and oppositional defiant
              disorder (28.1\%, 95\% CI 13.9-42.2). Of those with
              attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 84\% received a second

              Here, we assess evidence of the readiness of R-fMRI based
              functional connectomics to lead to clinically meaningful
              biomarker identification through the lens of the criteria used to
              evaluate clinical tests (i.e., validity, reliability,
              sensitivity, specificity, and applicability). We focus on current
              R-fMRI-based prediction efforts, and survey R-fMRI used for
              neurosurgical planning. We identify gaps and needs for
              R-fMRI-based biomarker identification, highlighting the potential
              of emerging conceptual, analytical and cultural innovations
              (e.g., the Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC), open science
              initiatives, and Big Data) to address them. Additionally, we note
              the need to expand future efforts beyond identification of
              biomarkers for disease status alone to include clinical variables
              related to risk, expected treatment response and prognosis.",

              activity, might contribute to these deficits. Of specific
              interest is the FC integrity of the default mode network (DMN), a
              network active during passive resting states and cognitive
              processes related to social deficits seen in ASD, e.g. Theory of
              Mind. We investigated the role of altered FC of default mode
              sub-networks (DM-SNs) in 16 patients with high-functioning ASD
              compared to 16 matched healthy controls of short resting fMRI
              scans using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a
              multivariate data-driven approach that identifies temporally
              coherent networks, providing a natural measure of FC. Results
              show that compared to controls, patients showed decreased FC
              between the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex/anterior
              cingulate cortex, DMN core areas, and other DM-SNs areas. FC
              magnitude in these regions inversely correlated with the severity
              of patients' social and communication deficits as measured by the
              Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule and the Social
              Responsiveness Scale. Importantly, supplemental analyses suggest
              that these results were independent of treatment status. These
              results support the hypothesis that DM-SNs under-connectivity
              contributes to the core deficits seen in ASD. Moreover, these
              data provide further support for the use of data-driven analysis
              with resting-state data for illuminating neural systems that
              differ between groups. This approach seems especially well suited
              for populations where compliance with and performance of active

               Autism affects more male than female individuals, and
               comorbidity is common (>70\% have concurrent conditions).
               Individuals with autism have atypical cognitive profiles, such
               as impaired social cognition and social perception, executive
               dysfunction, and atypical perceptual and information processing.
               These profiles are underpinned by atypical neural development at
               the systems level. Genetics has a key role in the aetiology of
               autism, in conjunction with developmentally early environmental
               factors. Large-effect rare mutations and small-effect common
